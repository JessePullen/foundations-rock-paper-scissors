# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## About the Project

This project was completed as part of the online course "The Odin Project" and was made to practice skills that have been learned so far.
It is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user can choose their input and they play against a randomly generated input acting as the computer.

## Part 1

Part 1 of this project involved creating a simple rock, paper, scissors game, primarily practicing:
-functions
-conditional statements
-for loops
-handling user input

The game is played entirely in the console and requires a round tally, score for the user and computer, and round information, like the winner of each round and their input.

## Part 2

The goal of part 2 was to move the game from the console to the webpage with a UI.
Buttons were added that received the players input using event handlers.
Game information was output to the user using DOM manipulation instead of the console.
Finally, this exercise practiced the use of git branching to allow for the implementation of new features whilst preserving the original, working code.
